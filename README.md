<h2>Hello, I'm Diamante</h2>
<ul>
<li>I reverse engineer old games and write code in C/C++, Python and Java.</li>
<li>In May of 2023 I launched <a href="https://alterware.dev/">AlterWare</a> ( <a href="https://github.com/alterware">GitHub</a> ) ( <a href="https://git.alterware.dev/AlterWare">Self-Hosted</a> ). It extends support for the XLabs clients that got shut down.</li>
<li>I maintain and improve IW4x, IW4x-SP, IW6-Mod, S1-Mod and the AlterWare Launcher as part of the AlterWare organization</li>
<li>I contributed to boiii/T7x, a game modification for Black Ops 3</li>
<li>I make custom plugins for <a href="https://namelessnoobs.com/">namelessnoobs.com</a>.</li>
<li>I was also part of the <a href="https://plutonium.pw/">Plutonium</a> team as a client developer</li>
<li>I fixed many denial-of-service vulnerabilities in the original games now supported by the clients I maintain. I also made the clients I am involved with more secure.</li>
</ul>

I recently became a technical SCUBA diver ðŸ¤¿
